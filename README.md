3. **Solve the Challenge**: Implement your solution by modifying the provided starter code.
4. **Test Your Solution**: Use the provided test cases to validate your solution.

### Old Projects

Each old project repository includes:

- **Project Overview**: A description of the project's purpose and scope.
- **Documentation**: Detailed documentation and user guides.
- **Source Code**: The complete source code of the project.

To explore an old project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
